Overview
========
The EDMA memory to memory example is a simple demonstration program that uses the SDK software.
It executes one shot transfer from source buffer to destination buffer using the SDK EDMA drivers.
The purpose of this example is to show how to use the EDMA and to provide a simple example for
debugging and further development.

SDK version
===========
- Version: 2.14.2

Toolchain supported
===================
- IAR embedded Workbench  9.40.2
- Keil MDK  5.38.1
- GCC ARM Embedded  12.2
- MCUXpresso  11.9.0

Hardware requirements
=====================
- Type-C USB cable
- FRDM-MCXA153 board
- Personal Computer

Board settings
==============
No special settings are required.

Prepare the Demo
================
1.  Connect a Type-C USB cable between the host PC and the MCU-Link port(J15) on the target board. 
2.  Open a serial terminal with the following settings:
    - 115200 baud rate
    - 8 data bits
    - No parity
    - One stop bit
    - No flow control
3.  Download the program to the target board.
4.  Either press the reset button on your board or launch the debugger in your IDE to begin running the demo.

Running the demo
================
When the example runs successfully, you can see the similar information from the terminal as below.
