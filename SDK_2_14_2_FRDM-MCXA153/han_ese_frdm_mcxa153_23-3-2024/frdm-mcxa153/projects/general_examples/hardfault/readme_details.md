# Hardfault

## Goal

Use the debugger and the hardfault handler to solve the hardfault errors in this project.

## Hardfaults

A hardfault exception is a special type of exception generated by the Cortex-M core. It is generally speaking not possible to recover from a hardfault exception. Examples of hardfault exceptions for the MCXA153 microcontrollers are:

- Accessing a peripheral register when the clock to that peripheral has not been enabled.
- Accessing a peripheral register when it is not released from reset.
- Unaligned memory access â€“ for example trying to read a 32-bit integer from an address that is not a multiple of four.

When a hardfault exception occurs, the Cortex-M core will generate a hardfault interrupt. The function prototype of this ISR is:

```C
void HardFault_Handler(void); 
```

The debugger can be used to verify if a hardfault has occurred, for example by setting a breakpoint in the hardfault ISR. As it is not possible to recover from a hardfault, hardfault ISRs are often implemented with an endless loop.

## Final assignment

The project contains **three** mistakes. Use the debugger as follows to solve the three mistakes:

- Build the project
- Start the debugger
- Step through the code until the hardfault ISR is executed
- What instruction caused the hardfault ISR to execute? 
- Stop the debugger
- Solve the problem

Repeat the above steps until all problems are solved. When all problems are solved correctly, the green RGB LED blinks.
